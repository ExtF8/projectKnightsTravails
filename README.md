# Knight Travails

## Introduction

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) and it focuses on implementing a function called 'knightMoves' in JavaScript, <br /> which calculates the shortest path for a knight to move from one square to another on a chessboard. <br /> A knight, a chess piece, moves in an L-shaped pattern - two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that direction. <br /> This project simulates the movement of a knight on an 8x8 chessboard, considering the rules of its movement.

### Features

-   `knightMoves`: Calculate the shortest path for a knight to move from one square to another of a chessboard.
-   Path Output: Output the full path of squares the knight will stop on along the way.
-   Move Counter: Provide the number of moves taken by the knight to reach the destination square.

### Technologies Used

-   JavaScript (ES6)
-   Node.js (for running JavaScript code)

## Usage

To get started with the Knight Travails project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:ExtF8/projectKnightTravails.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd projectKnightTravails
    ```
3. Running Tests:

-   The `script.js` file contains test cases for the Knight Travails implementation.
-   To run the tests, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
-   This command will execute the test script and display the results in the console.
-   You can modify the `script.js` file to add or customize test cases as needed.
